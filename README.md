# BOLDreams
boldreams is a suite of tools to train neural encoding models using the <a href=https://naturalscenesdataset.org/> Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD)</a>. The family of encoding models we deal with are the ones based on a pre-trained visual or text backbone. Here, a particular focus is on the interpretability and explainbility (xAI) of these models.
